# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The ShopWise Backend application is experiencing BSONError issues when handling ID parameters in MongoDB operations. The error occurs because MongoDB expects ObjectIds by default, but the application is designed to use UUID strings as identifiers. This feature will configure MongoDB schemas to use UUID strings as the `_id` field instead of ObjectIds, eliminating BSONError exceptions while maintaining the existing UUID-based ID system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want MongoDB to store UUID strings as `_id` fields so that database operations work seamlessly with the existing UUID system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating new documents THEN MongoDB SHALL store UUID strings directly as the `_id` field
2. WHEN querying documents by ID THEN MongoDB SHALL accept UUID strings without conversion
3. WHEN performing any MongoDB operation with IDs THEN the system SHALL NOT throw BSONError exceptions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Mongoose schemas configured to use string IDs so that the application behaves consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining Mongoose schemas THEN the system SHALL configure `_id` field as String type
2. WHEN extending Document class THEN the system SHALL specify string as the ID type parameter
3. WHEN all schemas are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UUID-based identification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper UUID validation for ID parameters so that invalid formats are caught early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an invalid UUID format is provided THEN the system SHALL return a BadRequestException with a clear error message
2. WHEN a valid UUID format is provided but the document doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL return a NotFoundException
3. WHEN UUID validation fails THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully without exposing internal details

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want utility functions for UUID validation so that I can reuse validation logic across services.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validating UUIDs THEN the system SHALL provide a reusable utility function
2. WHEN checking UUID validity THEN the system SHALL provide a validation utility that returns boolean results
3. WHEN validating UUID format THEN the system SHALL support both v4 UUID format and other valid UUID formats
