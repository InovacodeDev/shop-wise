# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will update the Purchases API and web application to return and display purchases grouped by month. Currently, the API returns all purchases as a flat list, and the web application displays them without any temporal organization. This enhancement will improve user experience by providing better organization and navigation of purchase history, making it easier for users to track their spending patterns over time.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to view my purchase history organized by month, so that I can easily track my spending patterns and find purchases from specific time periods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request purchases from the API THEN the system SHALL return purchases grouped by month and year
2. WHEN purchases are grouped by month THEN each group SHALL contain the month/year identifier and an array of purchases for that period
3. WHEN no purchases exist for a month THEN that month SHALL NOT be included in the response
4. WHEN purchases span multiple months THEN each month SHALL be represented as a separate group
5. WHEN I view purchases on the web application THEN they SHALL be displayed organized by month sections

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a family member, I want the monthly purchase groups to be sorted chronologically, so that I can easily navigate from recent to older purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monthly purchase groups are returned THEN they SHALL be sorted in descending chronological order (newest month first)
2. WHEN purchases within a month group are returned THEN they SHALL be sorted in descending chronological order (newest purchase first)
3. WHEN displaying monthly groups on the web THEN the most recent month SHALL appear at the top
4. WHEN displaying purchases within a month THEN the most recent purchase SHALL appear at the top

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a family member, I want each monthly group to include summary information, so that I can quickly understand my spending for that month without examining individual purchases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a monthly group is returned THEN it SHALL include the total amount spent for that month
2. WHEN a monthly group is returned THEN it SHALL include the count of purchases for that month
3. WHEN a monthly group is returned THEN it SHALL include the month and year in a readable format
4. WHEN displaying monthly groups on the web THEN the summary information SHALL be prominently displayed for each month

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a family member, I want the API to maintain backward compatibility, so that existing functionality continues to work while the new monthly grouping is implemented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the existing `/families/:familyId/purchases` endpoint is called THEN it SHALL continue to return the flat list of purchases for backward compatibility
2. WHEN a new endpoint for monthly grouped purchases is created THEN it SHALL be accessible at `/families/:familyId/purchases/by-month`
3. WHEN the web application is updated THEN it SHALL use the new monthly endpoint for display purposes
4. WHEN other systems or components rely on the flat list THEN they SHALL continue to function without modification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a family member, I want to be able to expand and collapse monthly sections on the web interface, so that I can focus on specific time periods and manage screen space efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing monthly purchase groups on the web THEN each month section SHALL be collapsible/expandable
2. WHEN I click on a month header THEN the purchases for that month SHALL toggle between visible and hidden
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the current month SHALL be expanded by default and previous months SHALL be collapsed
4. WHEN I expand a month section THEN it SHALL show all purchases for that month with full details
5. WHEN a month section is collapsed THEN only the month header and summary information SHALL be visible

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the monthly grouping logic to handle edge cases properly, so that the system remains reliable across different scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a purchase has no date THEN it SHALL be grouped into a "No Date" category at the bottom of the list
2. WHEN a purchase has an invalid date THEN it SHALL be grouped into a "No Date" category at the bottom of the list
3. WHEN there are no purchases for a family THEN the API SHALL return an empty array
4. WHEN the API encounters an error THEN it SHALL return appropriate error responses with meaningful messages
5. WHEN purchases span across different years THEN they SHALL be grouped by month and year (e.g., "January 2024", "January 2023")
